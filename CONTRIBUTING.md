# Contributing / Development

Contributions to Nebula Logger are welcome, however we ask that Apex Prettier be run on prior to any pull requests being submitted to this repo.

When developing, to get started:

-   run `npm -i` or `npm install` or `yarn` to grab the latest version of our dependencies
-   when using VS Code: ensure that your "Format On Save" editor option is set to `true` (in `settings.json`: `"editor.formatOnSave": true`)
-   all unit tests should be run and passing prior to submitting a PR
