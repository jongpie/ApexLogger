## Installing

You can choose to install the unlocked package, you can deploy the metadata from this repo to your org, or you can install the managed package. The metadata is the same in all 3 options, but there are some differences in using the 3 versions. All examples in README are for the unlocked package/unpackaged metadata (no namespace) - simply add the `Nebula` namespace from the examples if you are using the managed package.

## Getting Started

After deploying Nebula Logger to your org, there are a few additional configuration changes needed...

-   Assign permission set(s) to users
    -   `LoggerLogCreator` provides the minimum access needed for users to generate logs via Apex, Flow or Process Builder
    -   `LoggerEndUser` provides access to generate logs, as well as read-only access to any log records shared with the user.
    -   `LoggerLogViewer` provides view-all access (read-only) to all log records. This does **not** provide access to generate logs.
    -   `LoggerAdmin` provides view-all and modify-all access to all log records.
-   Customize the default settings in `LoggerSettings__c`
    -   You can customize settings at the org, profile and user levels
-   Unlocked Package Only: Enable Salesforce Topics for the `Log__c` and `LogEntry__c` objects for tagging/labeling. See [Salesforce Help](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.collab_topics_records_admin.htm) for more details.
    -   Currently, enabling Topics for objects must still be done using the Salesforce Classic UI. Once enabled, Topics can then be used from withing Lightning Experience.
    -   Once enabled, Topics can be added via Apex and Flow and then used as list view filters (and more) for the object `Log__c`.

### Logger for Apex: Quick Start

For Apex developers, the `Logger` class has several methods that can be used to add entries with different logging levels. Each logging level's method has several overloads to support multiple parameters.

```java
// This will generate a debug statement within developer console
System.debug('Debug statement using native Apex');

// This will create a new `Log__c` record with multiple related `LogEntry__c` records
Logger.error('Add log entry using Nebula Logger with logging level == ERROR');
Logger.warn('Add log entry using Nebula Logger with logging level == WARN');
Logger.info('Add log entry using Nebula Logger with logging level == INFO');
Logger.debug('Add log entry using Nebula Logger with logging level == DEBUG');
Logger.fine('Add log entry using Nebula Logger with logging level == FINE');
Logger.finer('Add log entry using Nebula Logger with logging level == FINER');
Logger.finest('Add log entry using Nebula Logger with logging level == FINEST');
Logger.saveLog();
```

This results in 1 `Log__c` record with several related `LogEntry__c` records.

![Apex Log Results](./content/apex-log.png)

---

### Logger for Flow & Process Builder: Quick Start

Within Flow & Process Builder, you can select 1 of the several Logging actions

![Flow Logger Actions](./content/flow-logger-actions.png)

In this simple example, a Flow is configured after-insert and after-update to log a Case record (using the action 'Add Log Entry for an SObject Record')

![Flow Builder: Log Case](./content/flow-builder-log-case.png)

This results in a `Log__c` record with related `LogEntry__c` records.

![Flow Log Results](./content/flow-log.png)

---

### All Together: Apex & Flow in One Log

After incorporating Logger into your Flows & Apex code (including controllers, trigger framework, etc.), you'll have a unified transaction log of all your declarative & custom code automations.

```java
Case currentCase = [SELECT Id, CaseNumber, Type, Status, IsClosed FROM Case LIMIT 1];

Logger.info('First, log the case through Apex', currentCase);

Logger.debug('Now, we update the case in Apex to cause our record-triggered Flow to run');
update currentCase;

Logger.info('Last, save our log');
Logger.saveLog();
```

This generates 1 consolidated `Log__c`, containing `LogEntry__c` records from both Apex and Flow

![Flow Log Results](./content/combined-apex-flow-log.png)

---

## Features for Apex Developers

Within Apex, there are several different methods that you can use that provide greater control over the logging system.

### Transaction Controls

Apex developers can use additional `Logger` methods to dynamically control how logs are saved during the current transaction.

-   `Logger.suspendSaving()` – causes `Logger` to ignore any calls to `saveLog()` in the current transaction until `resumeSaving()` is called. Useful for reducing DML statements used by `Logger`
-   `Logger.resumeSaving()` – re-enables saving after `suspendSaving()` is used
-   `Logger.flushBuffer()` – discards any unsaved log entries
-   `Logger.setSaveMethod(SaveMethod saveMethod)` - sets the default save method used when calling `saveLog()`. Any subsequent calls to `saveLog()` in the current transaction will use the specified save method
-   `Logger.saveLog(SaveMethod saveMethod)` - saves any entries in Logger's buffer, using the specified save method for only this call. All subsequent calls to `saveLog()` will use the default save method.
-   Enum `Logger.SaveMethod` - this enum can be used for both `Logger.setSaveMethod(saveMethod)` and `Logger.saveLog(saveMethod)`
    -   `Logger.SaveMethod.EVENT_BUS` - The default save method, this uses the `EventBus` class to publish `LogEntryEvent__e` records. The default save method can also be controlled declaratively by updating the field `LoggerSettings__c.DefaultSaveMethod__c`
    -   `Logger.SaveMethod.QUEUEABLE` - This save method will trigger `Logger` to save any pending records asynchronously using a queueable job. This is useful when you need to defer some CPU usage and other limits consumed by Logger.
    -   `Logger.SaveMethod.REST` - This save method will use the current user’s session ID to make a synchronous callout to the org’s REST API. This is useful when you have other callouts being made and you need to avoid mixed DML operations.
    -   `Logger.SaveMethod.SYNCHRONOUS_DML` - This save method will skip publishing the `LogEntryEvent__e` platform events, and instead immediately creates `Log__c` and `LogEntry__c` records. This is useful when you are logging from within the context of another platform event and/or you do not anticipate any exceptions to occur in the current transaction. **Note**: when using this save method, any exceptions will prevent your log entries from being saved - Salesforce will rollback any DML statements, including your log entries! Use this save method cautiously.

### Track Related Logs in Batchable and Queuable Jobs

In Salesforce, asynchronous jobs like batchable and queuable run in separate transactions - each with their own unique transaction ID. To relate these jobs back to the original log, Apex developers can use the method Logger.setParentLogTransactionId(String). `Logger` uses this value to relate child `Log__c` records, using the field `Log__c.ParentLog__c`.

This example batchable class shows how you can leverage this feature to relate all of your batch job’s logs together.

> :information_source: If you deploy this example class to your org,you can run it using `Database.executeBatch(new BatchableLoggerExample());`

```java
public with sharing class BatchableLoggerExample implements Database.Batchable<SObject>, Database.Stateful {
    private String originalTransactionId;

    public Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext batchableContext) {
        // Each batchable method runs in a separate transaction
        // ...so store the first transaction ID to later relate the other transactions
        this.originalTransactionId = Logger.getTransactionId();

        Logger.info('Starting BatchableLoggerExample');
        Logger.saveLog();

        // Just as an example, query all accounts
        return Database.getQueryLocator([SELECT Id, Name, RecordTypeId FROM Account]);
    }

    public void execute(Database.BatchableContext batchableContext, List<Account> scope) {
        // One-time call (per transaction) to set the parent log
        Logger.setParentLogTransactionId(this.originalTransactionId);

        for (Account account : scope) {
            // TODO add your batch job's logic

            // Then log the result
            Logger.info('Processed an account record', account);
        }

        Logger.saveLog();
    }

    public void finish(Database.BatchableContext batchableContext) {
        // The finish method runs in yet-another transaction, so set the parent log again
        Logger.setParentLogTransactionId(this.originalTransactionId);

        Logger.info('Finishing running BatchableLoggerExample');
        Logger.saveLog();
    }
}
```

Queueable jobs can also leverage the parent transaction ID to relate logs together. This example queueable job will run several chained instances. Each instance uses the parentLogTransactionId to relate its log back to the original instance's log.

> :information_source: If you deploy this example class to your org,you can run it using `System.enqueueJob(new QueueableLoggerExample(3));`

```java
public with sharing class QueueableLoggerExample implements Queueable {
    private Integer numberOfJobsToChain;
    private String parentLogTransactionId;

    private List<LogEntryEvent__e> logEntryEvents = new List<LogEntryEvent__e>();

    // Main constructor - for demo purposes, it accepts an integer that controls how many times the job runs
    public QueueableLoggerExample(Integer numberOfJobsToChain) {
        this(numberOfJobsToChain, null);
    }

    // Second constructor, used to pass the original transaction's ID to each chained instance of the job
    // You don't have to use a constructor - a public method or property would work too.
    // There just needs to be a way to pass the value of parentLogTransactionId between instances
    public QueueableLoggerExample(Integer numberOfJobsToChain, String parentLogTransactionId) {
        this.numberOfJobsToChain = numberOfJobsToChain;
        this.parentLogTransactionId = parentLogTransactionId;
    }

    // Creates some log entries and starts a new instance of the job when applicable (based on numberOfJobsToChain)
    public void execute(System.QueueableContext queueableContext) {
        Logger.setParentLogTransactionId(this.parentLogTransactionId);

        Logger.fine('queueableContext==' + queueableContext);
        Logger.info('this.numberOfJobsToChain==' + this.numberOfJobsToChain);
        Logger.info('this.parentLogTransactionId==' + this.parentLogTransactionId);

        // TODO add your queueable job's logic

        Logger.saveLog();

        --this.numberOfJobsToChain;
        if (this.numberOfJobsToChain > 0) {
            String parentLogTransactionId = this.parentLogTransactionId != null ? this.parentLogTransactionId : Logger.getTransactionId();
            System.enqueueJob(new QueueableLoggerExample(this.numberOfJobsToChain, parentLogTransactionId));
        }
    }
}
```

### Overloads for Logging Methods

Each of the logging methods in `Logger` (such as `Logger.error()`, `Logger.debug()`, and so on) has several static overloads for various parameters. These are intended to provide simple method calls for common parameters, such as:

-   Log a message and a record - `Logger.error(String message, SObject record)`
-   Log a message and a record ID - `Logger.error(String message, Id recordId)`
-   Log a message and a save result - `Logger.error(String message, Database.SaveResult saveResult)`
-   ...

To see the full list of overloads, check out the `Logger` class [documentation](https://jongpie.github.io/NebulaLogger/logger-engine/Logger).

### Using the Fluent Interface

Each of the logging methods in `Logger` returns an instance of the class `LogEntryEventBuilder`. This class provides several additional methods together to further customize each log entry - each of the builder methods can be chained together. In this example Apex, 3 log entries are created using different approaches for calling `Logger` - all 3 approaches result in identical log entries.

```java
// Get the current user so we can log it (just as an example of logging an SObject)
User currentUser = [SELECT Id, Name, Username, Email FROM User WHERE Id = :UserInfo.getUserId()];

// Using static Logger method overloads
Logger.debug('my string', currentUser);

// Using the instance of LogEntryEventBuilder
LogEntryEventBuilder builder = Logger.debug('my string');
builder.setRecord(currentUser);

// Chaining builder methods together
Logger.debug('my string').setRecord(currentUser);

// Save all of the log entries
Logger.saveLog();
```

### Using LogMessage to Improve CPU Usage for String Formatting

The class `LogMessage` provides the ability to generate string messages on demand, using `String.format()`. This provides 2 benefits:

1. Improved CPU usage by skipping unnecessary calls to `String.format()`

    ```java
    // Without using LogMessage, String.format() is always called, even if the FINE logging level is not enabled for a user
    String formattedString = String.format('my example with input: {0}', List<Object>{'myString'});
    Logger.fine(formattedString);

    // With LogMessage, when the specified logging level (FINE) is disabled for the current user, `String.format()` is not called
    LogMessage logMessage = new LogMessage('my example with input: {0}', 'myString');
    Logger.fine(logMessage);
    ```

2. Easily build complex strings
    ```java
     // There are several constructors for LogMessage to support different numbers of parameters for the formatted string
     String unformattedMessage = 'my string with 3 inputs: {0} and then {1} and finally {2}';
     String formattedMessage = new LogMessage(unformattedMessage, 'something', 'something else', 'one more').getMessage();
     String expectedMessage = 'my string with 3 inputs: something and then something else and finally one more';
     System.assertEquals(expectedMessage, formattedMessage);
    ```

For more details, check out the `LogMessage` class [documentation](https://jongpie.github.io/NebulaLogger/logger-engine/LogMessage).

## Features for Flow Builders

Within Flow (and Process Builder), there are 4 invocable actions that you can use to leverage Nebula Logger

1. 'Add Log Entry' - uses the class `FlowLogEntry` to add a log entry with a specified message
2. 'Add Log Entry for an SObject Record' - uses the class `FlowRecordLogEntry` to add a log entry with a specified message for a particular SObject record
3. 'Add Log Entry for an SObject Record Collection' - uses the class `FlowCollectionLogEntry` to add a log entry with a specified message for an SObject record collection
4. 'Save Log' - uses the class `Logger` to save any pending logs

![Flow Builder: Logging Invocable Actions](./content/flow-builder-logging-invocable-actions.png)

---

## Log Management

### Logger Console App

The Logger Console app provides access to `Log__c` and `LogEntry__c` object tabs (for any users with the correct access).

![Logger Console app](./content/logger-console-app.png)

### Log's 'Manage' Quick Action

To help development and support teams better manage logs (and any underlying code or config issues), some fields on `Log__c` are provided to track the owner, priority and status of a log. These fields are optional, but are helpful in critical environments (production, QA sandboxes, UAT sandboxes, etc.) for monitoring ongoing user activities.

-   All editable fields on `Log__c` can be updated via the 'Manage Log' quick action (shown below)

    ![Manage Log QuickAction](./content/manage-log-quickaction.png)

-   Additional fields are automatically set based on changes to `Log__c.Status__c`
    -   `Log__c.ClosedBy__c` - The user who closed the log
    -   `Log__c.ClosedDate__c` - The datetime that the log was closed
    -   `Log__c.IsClosed__c` - Indicates if the log is closed, based on the selected status (and associated config in the 'Log Status' custom metadata type)
    -   `Log__c.IsResolved__c` - Indicates if the log is resolved (meaning that it required analaysis/work, which has been completed). Only closed statuses can be considered resolved. This is also driven based on the selected status (and associated config in the 'Log Status' custom metadata type)
-   To customize the statuses provided, simply update the picklist values for `Log__c.Status__c` and create/update corresponding records in the custom metadata type `LogStatus__mdt`. This custom metadata type controls which statuses are considerd closed and resolved.

---

### Log's 'View JSON' Quick Action

Everyone loves JSON - so to make it easy to see a JSON version of a `Log__c` record, you can use the 'View JSON' quick action button. It displays the current `Log__c` + all related `LogEntry__c` records in JSON format, as well as a handy button to copy the JSON to your clipboard. All fields that the current user can view (based on field-level security) are dynamically returned, including any custom fields added directly in your org or by plugins.

![View JSON Log QuickAction Button](./content/view-json-log-quickaction-btn.png)

![View JSON Log QuickAction](./content/view-json-log-quickaction.png)

---

### View Related Log Entries on a Record Page

Within App Builder, admins can add the 'Related Log Entries' lightning web component to any record page. Admins can also control which columns are displayed be creating & selecting a field set on `LogEntry__c` with the desired fields.

-   The component automatically shows any related log entries, based on `LogEntry__c.RecordId__c == :recordId`
-   Users can search the list of log entries for a particular record using the component's built-insearch box. The component dynamically searches all related log entries using SOSL.
-   Component automatically enforces Salesforce's security model
    -   Object-Level Security - Users without read access to `LogEntry__c` will not see the component
    -   Record-Level Security - Users will only see records that have been shared with them
    -   Field-Level Security - Users will only see the fields within the field set that they have access to

![Related Log Entries](./content/relate-log-entries-lwc.png)

---

### Deleting Old Logs

Admins can easily delete old logs using 2 methods: list views or Apex batch jobs

#### Mass Deleting with List Views

Salesforce (still) does not support mass deleting records out-of-the-box. There's been [an Idea for 11+ years](https://trailblazer.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000BqczAAC) about it, but it's still not standard functionality. A custom button is available on `Log__c` list views to provide mass deletion functionality.

1. Admins can select 1 or more `Log__c` records from the list view to choose which logs will be deleted

![Mass Delete Selection](./content/log-mass-delete-selection.png)

2. The button shows a Visualforce page `LogMassDelete` to confirm that the user wants to delete the records

![Mass Delete Confirmation](./content/log-mass-delete-confirmation.png)

#### Batch Deleting with Apex Jobs

Two Apex classes are provided out-of-the-box to handle automatically deleting old logs

1. `LogBatchPurger` - this batch Apex class will delete any `Log__c` records with `Log__c.LogRetentionDate__c <= System.today()`.
    - By default, this field is populated with "TODAY + 14 DAYS" - the number of days to retain a log can be customized in `LoggerSettings__c`.
    - Admins can also manually edit this field to change the retention date - or set it to null to prevent the log from being automatically deleted
2. `LogBatchPurgeScheduler` - this schedulable Apex class can be schedule to run `LogBatchPurger` on a daily or weekly basis

---

## Beta Feature: Custom Plugin Framework for Log\_\_c and LogEntry\_\_c objects

If you want to add your own automation to the `Log__c` or `LogEntry__c` objects, you can leverage Apex or Flow to define "plugins" - the logger system will then automatically run the plugins after each trigger event (BEFORE_INSERT, BEFORE_UPDATE, AFTER_INSERT, AFTER_UPDATE, and so on). This framework makes it easy to build your own plugins, or deploy/install others' prebuilt packages, without having to modify the logging system directly.

-   Flow plugins: your Flow should be built as auto-launched Flows with these parameters:

    1. `Input` parameter `triggerOperationType` - The name of the current trigger operation (such as BEFORE_INSERT, BEFORE_UPDATE, etc.)
    2. `Input` parameter `triggerNew` - The list of logger records being processed (`Log__c` or `LogEntry__c` records)
    3. `Output` parameter `updatedTriggerNew` - If your Flow makes any updates to the collection of records, you should return a record collection containing the updated records
    4. `Input` parameter `triggerOld` - The list of logger records as they exist in the datatabase

-   Apex plugins: your Apex class should extend the abstract class `LoggerSObjectHandlerPlugin`. For example:

    ```java
    public class ExamplePlugin extends LoggerSObjectHandlerPlugin {
        public override void execute(
            TriggerOperation triggerOperationType,
            List<SObject> triggerNew,
            Map<Id, SObject> triggerNewMap,
            List<SObject> triggerOld,
            Map<Id, SObject> triggerOldMap
        ) {
            switch on triggerOperationType {
                when BEFORE_INSERT {
                    for (Log__c log : (List<Log__c>) triggerNew) {
                        log.Status__c = 'On Hold';
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    ```

Once you've created your Apex or Flow plugin(s), you will also need to configure the plugin:

-   'Logger Plugin' - use the custom metadata type `LoggerSObjectHandlerPlugin__mdt` to define your plugin, including the plugin type (Apex or Flow) and the API name of your plugin's Apex class or Flow
-   'Logger Plugin Parameter' - use the custom metadata type `LoggerSObjectHandlerPluginParameter__mdt` to define any configurable parameters needed for your plugin, such as environment-specific URLs and other similar configurations

![Logger plugin: configuration](./content/slack-plugin-configuration.png)

Note: the logger plugin framework is not available in the managed package due to some platform limitations & considerations with some of the underlying code. The unlocked package is recommended (instead of the managed package) when possible, including if you want to be able to leverage the plugin framework in your org.

### Beta Plugin: Slack Integration

The optional [Slack plugin](./nebula-logger-plugins/Slack/) leverages the Nebula Logger plugin framework to automatically send Slack notifications for logs that meet a certain (configurable) logging level. The plugin also serves as a functioning example of how to build your own plugin for Nebula Logger, such as how to:

-   Use Apex to apply custom logic to `Log__c` and `LogEntry__c` records
-   Add custom fields and list views to Logger's objects
-   Extend permission sets to include field-level security for your custom fields
-   Leverage the new `LoggerSObjectHandlerPluginParameter__mdt` CMDT object to store configuration for your plugin

Check out the [Slack plugin](./nebula-logger-plugins/Slack/) for more details on how to install & customize the plugin

![Slack plugin: notification](./content/slack-plugin-notification.png)

## Uninstalling/Removing Logger

If you want to remove the unlocked or managed packages, you can do so by simply uninstalling them in your org under Setup --> Installed Packages.

![Uninstall Packages](./content/installed-packages-uninstall-option.png)
